ðŸŸ§ Linked List
Linear

Non-contiguous (elements are not stored together in memory)

Dynamic size (can grow or shrink easily)

Node = (value + pointers)

Getting element is hard

Insertion/Deletion is easy

Extra memory required (for pointers)

ðŸŸ¨ Arrays
Linear

Contiguous (elements are stored together in memory)

Fixed size (can be dynamic with effort)

Just value (no pointers)

Getting element is easy

Insertion/Deletion is complex

Memory efficient
